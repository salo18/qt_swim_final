üåä üåä Welcome to QT Swim www.qtswim.comüåä üåä

I swim in Lake Wakatipu (in Queenstown üá≥üáø) every day. It's cold but I always feel great after. Unfortunately, there have been small spills in the lake and days when I probably shouldn't swim. There is no alert system in place to let residents know about the water quality readings so I wanted to create one.

For example, there was a spill in March 2023.

The only notice given in town was a QLDC Facebook post. I rarely check Facebook so there was no way to know about the spill. I only found out because a friend told me AFTER I swam close to the spot.

This app scrapes data from https://www.lawa.org.nz/explore-data/otago-region/swimming/lake-wakatipu-at-frankton-bay/swimsite once a day. This data comes from the Otago Regional Council which does a reading of bacteria levels in the lake every week or two. The app emails users every time there is a new update so we don't have to remember to check the site ourselves.

Unfortunately, the data is only updated once or twice a month. It would be nice to get updates more often but I am constrained by the data provided on LAWA.org.nz.

This was my first full stack app. It's not much but it does something useful and I learned a ton by building it! What I learned with this project üìö
- How to scrape data with puppeteer
- How to make a cron job
  - Crontab was helpful https://crontab.guru/#0_*_*_*_*
- Basics of package.json configuration
- First time using Next.js
  - Learned about its SEO benefits, static generation vs server side rendering and more
- How to deploy an app to Vercel (and fixing lots deployment issues - more on that below)
- More experience working with MongoDB
- Setting up email using nodemailer and basic knowledge of SMTP
  - helpful links for working with nodemailer:
      https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/issues/830#issuecomment-817279450
      https://openjavascript.info/2023/01/10/nodemailer-tutorial-send-emails-in-node-js/
- Lots of practice debugging problems üêõ

Challenges with this project:
- Deployment to Vercel was challenging because of Puppeteer. The Puppeteer dependency was too large to deploy to Vercel (over the 50MB compressed size limit). So I switched to Playwright, which is another scraping tool. I had the same issue. It took me MANY attempts to solve this issue but was able to deploy using older versions of the packages that aren't as big as newer deployments. The magic combination was:
  --- "chrome-aws-lambda": "6.0.0",
  --- "next": "12.3.1",
  --- "puppeteer-core": "6.0.0"
  Thanks to these articles that took a while to find but solved the problem:

- I had a hard time getting the cron job to run on vercel. I could get the cron jobs to work locally but not in deployment. I used tryslater.com and it was really easy to set up.
- I originally made this project using ExpressJS. I scrapped that approach once I started learning Next.js since I realized Next could handle both frontend and backend.
- Also learned about Express middleware and CORS. Didn't end up using those concepts in the project but it took me reading lots of documentation to realize that wasn't needed on this project.

I didn't worry too much about folder structure too much. The one React form component is not in its own file and neither are the CSS styles for the form. I wanted to move fast and I chose to ignore folder structure conventions since it is a very small project and I am not reusing any components.

V2 of this app could...
- Show the time to next cron job (next check will be in X hours)
- Allow users to unsubscribe from email alerts (currently handled manually)
- Give option to sign up to text alerts
- Add more locations... This only tracks the results of samples at Frankton Beach. ORC also does samples of Queenstown beach and many other lakes. I could allow users to subscribe for alerts at multiple lakes.

That's all for now! This was a fun project and I am excited to move on to a new challenge.

- Salo
